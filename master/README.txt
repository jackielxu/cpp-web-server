Hi there! 

This is our final project submission, a very simple blogging website made from C++!

For full instructions on how to build and compile the website, check out: https://github.com/jackielxu/cpp-web-server. All the files are included here, and screenshots of the simple website are included in the folder. Traversing through the screenshots in the prescribed order is recommended. 

Enjoy!
